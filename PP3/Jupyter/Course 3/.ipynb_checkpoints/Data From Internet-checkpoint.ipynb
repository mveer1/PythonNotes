    "1. what is REST API??\n",
    "API - application program interface\n",
    "REST - representational state transfer\n",
    "But in everyday parlance, a REST API just means a website that produces data intended for another computer program to consume, rather than something intended to be displayed to people in a browser. A REST API will respond to requests in a particular format and some things are common across many APIs about the format, but some things are specific to the particular API\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Caching?\n",
    "Caching is a way to reduce the total number of calls that you have to make to the APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Anatomy of URLs\n",
    "    commonly \n",
    "URL http://umich.edu/about\n",
    "here, http is our protocol \n",
    "umcih.edu is our server or domain\n",
    "about is our argument or path\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the server says where to fetch something from, and the argument says what to fetch from that remote server. The protocol \n",
    "says how to communicate with that remote server.\n",
    "\n",
    "    generally\n",
    "    url <scheme>://<host>:<port>/<path>\n",
    "other than http and https Other schemes that you will sometimes see include ftp (for file transfer) and mailto (for email addresses).\n",
    "    Alternatively, the host can be an IP address directly. This is less common, because IP addresses are harder to remember and because a URL containing a domain name will continue to work even if the remote server keeps its domain name but moves to a different IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "The :port is optional. If it is omitted, the default port number is 80.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-5. more on HTTP? \n",
    "HTTP is technically (previously) documented as IETF RFC 2616.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. DNS and IP addresses\n",
    "Every computer that's attached to the internet has a unique identifier, an address. It's called the IP address. IP stands for Internet Protocol. No two computers that are connected to the internet have the same IP address at the same time. When the computer disconnects, you might get another computer getting to reuse that IP address.\n",
    " So the internet has something called the DNS, the Domain Name System, that is setup to resolve names like www.si.umich.edu and turn them into these unique identifiers, the IP addresses. An IP address will look something like 159.89.239.247. In each of those four chunks (seperated by dots). we have to have a number between zero and 255.\n",
    " Each chunk is represented by 8bits, hence the whole ip address is also called 32bit address\n",
    " \n",
    "5. Routers and routing?-\n",
    "Routers are just computers whose sole job is to receive these data packets and pass them on.\n",
    "     \n",
    "6. sending and receiving from the network and whats https    \n",
    " Before connecting to a URL, The first thing that's going to happen, is my computer is going to take this domain name www.si.umich.edu convert it into an IP address\n",
    "  Then my computer makes a connection to the remote computer. If I were using HTTPS, that's the secure version, then the first thing that my computer would do was send some information back and forth to the si.umich.edu server that would establish encryption keys so that all of the rest of the communication would be encrypted\n",
    "  \n",
    "   After that setup has happened, now my browser will start to send messages and it will actually send text, it'll send the word  GET and then it'll send the arguments (after the slash).\n",
    "65. WHat and types are headers\n",
    "   (request headers) So it will say what path we're looking for, it will also send some headers saying things like, hey I'm a Chrome browser or I'm an Internet Explorer browser, the current time is certain time, it'll give a time stamp and a few other headers,\n",
    "   (response headers) we will then receive back from that server some response headers. Those response headers will say things like, I'm sending you HTML and the current timestamp is such and such and there are a few others. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Then most importantly, si.umich.edu is going to send me some HTML, and that HTML my browser is going to take and turn it into what we are used to seeing in a browser, a webpage. So the browser renders that HTML.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   note - also, both of the headers can be seen from the inspect tool.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   note - after the slash. A very common format is to have some path name, and then we have the character question mark. After the question mark, we get query parameters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Step 1: the client makes a request to the server.\n",
    "    1. If the request only involves fetching data, the client sends a message of the form GET <path>, where <path> is the path part of the URL\n",
    "    2. If the request involves sending some data (e.g., a file upload, or some authentication information), the message starts with POST\n",
    "    In either case, the client sends some HTTP headers. These include:\n",
    "        The type of client program. This allows the server to send back different things to small mobile devices than desktop browsers (a “responsive” website)\n",
    "        Any cookies that the server previously asked the client to hold onto. This allows the server to continue previous interactions, rather than treating every request as stand-alone. It also allows ad networks to place personalized ads.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Step 2: Step 2: the server responds to the client.\n",
    "    1.The server first sends back some HTTP headers. These include:\n",
    "a response code indicating whether the server thinks it has fulfilled the request or not.\n",
    "    2. A description of the type of content it is sending back (e.g., text/html when it is sending html-formatted text).\n",
    "    3. Any cookies it would like the client to hold onto and send back the next time it communicates with the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Using REST APIs\n",
    "Request to an API is made by visiting a URL. Some APIs use a different part of the HTTP protocol, called the post mechanism, in which case not all of the requests is encoded right into the URL. But we're going to focus only on the simplest mechanism, the HTTP get request, where the entire request is encoded in the URL.\n",
    "75. WHAT are key value pairs (in arguments of rest apis url)\n",
    "    The base URL. The domain name, and the first part of the path up through slash search. Then we've got the question mark character. Then we have these key equals value pairs.\n",
    "     These key value pairs are key equals value. There's always an equal sign between the key and the value. Between the pairs, there's an ampersand. That's the basic structure of a request to a REST API."

    "a URL path is not allowed to include the double -quote character. It also can’t include a : or / or a space.

Then try running the code below to fetch the same text string in a python program. Try changing “funny” to some other word, both in the browser, and in the code below.

    "### In the Runestone environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In our limited implementation of the requests library for the Runestone environment, if your request fails for any reason, you will still get a Response object. \n",
    "1. Most likely, there would be a problem because you invoke the .json() method on the Response object and you get an error that refers to an “unexpected token” in the JSON. When that happens, you should print out the values of the .text and .url attributes.\n",
    "2. If it was unable to use your baseurl and params value to create a url string, the .url attribute will be “Couldn’t generate a valid URL” and the .text attribute will be set to “<h.tml><b.ody><h.1>invalid request</h1></body></html>”.  #kept the dots to avoid the browser actually considering them as tags\n",
    "In that case, you should check that the value you passed for the params parameter is indeed a dictionary and that its keys and values are all strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If it generated a url string but failed to fetch data from the server described by the url string, the .url attribute will be set correctly and the .text attribute will be set to “Failed to retrieve that URL”.\n",
    "In that case, you should examine the url to try to figure out what went wrong. In particular, print it, then copy and paste it to a browser window and see what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In a full python environment\n",
    "\n",
    ", you will not always get a Response object back from a call to requests.get. \n",
    "\n",
    "What you get back will generally be even more informative than what you get in the Runestone environment, but you have to know where to look.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first thing that might go wrong is that you get a runtime error when you call requests.get(dest_url). There are two possibilities for what’s gone wrong in that case.\n",
    "    One possibility is that the value provided for the params parameter is not a valid dictionary or doesn’t have key-value pairs that can be converted into text strings suitable for putting into a URL. \n",
    "        For example, if you execute requests.get(\"http://github.com\", params = [0,1]), [0,1] is a list rather than a dictionary and the python interpreter generates the error, TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    The second possibility is that the variable dest_url is either not bound to a string, or is bound to a string that isn’t a valid URL. \n",
    "        For example, it might be bound to the string \"http://foo.bar/bat\". foo.bar is not a valid domain name that can be resolved to an ip address, so there’s no server to contact. That will yield an error of type requests.exceptions.ConnectionError. Here’s a complete error message:\n",
    "            `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='foo.bar', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: /bat?key=val (Caused by <class 'socket.gaierror'>: [Errno 11004] getaddrinfo failed)`\n",
    "            \n",
    "The best approach is to look at the URL that is produced, eyeball it, and plug it into a browser to see what happens. Unfortunately, if the call to requests.get produces an error, you won’t get a Response object, so you’ll need some other way to see what URL was produced. \n",

    "Sometimes, you may need to deal with text like é, ö, Ф, or ¥. This is especially likely if you use REST APIs to fetch user-contributed content from social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, or flickr.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s strings are in unicode, including more than 75,000 ideographic characters. Everything works fine inside Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things only get tricky when you want to input strings into Python, or print them to an output window or write them to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For output, your terminal (output) window will typically be set up to display characters only from a restricted set of languages (perhaps just English). If you issue a print statement on a string containing other characters, it may not display correctly in your terminal window. Indeed, you may get an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to store unicode text in a file, you have to choose an “encoding”. This is analogous to the encoding of special characters in a URL string, but not the same. In a file, each unicode character has to be encoded as one or more “bytes” for storage in a file. We have avoided low-level details about data encodings until now, but understanding a little about bits and bytes will help make sense of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2^^8=256 distinct eight-bit bytes. If we only had 256 possible letters in our alphabet, we could simply encode each letter as one of the available bytes. When we restrict ourselves to regular python strings, using only the ASCII alphabet (English, plus a few special characters), the encoding is that simple, so simple that we haven’t had to think about it before.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are 75,000 possible characters, they can’t all be encoded with a single byte, because there are only 256 distinct bytes (eight-bit sequences). There are many possible encodings. The one you will be most likely to encounter, using REST APIs, is called UTF-8. A single unicode character is mapped to a sequence of up to four bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you read in a UTF-8 encoded text, and get the contents using .read() or .readlines(), you will need to “decode” the contents in order to turn it into a proper unicode string that you can read and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the requests module will normally handle this for us automatically. When we fetch a webpage that is in json format, the webpage will have a header called ‘content-type’ that will say something like application/json; charset=utf8. If it specifies the utf8 character set in that way, the requests module will automatically decode the contents into unicode: requests.get('that web page').text will yield a string, with each of those sequences of one to four bytes coverted into a single character.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, for some reason, you get json-formatted text that is utf-encoded but the requests module hasn’t magically decoded it for you, the json.loads() function call can take care of the decoding for you. loads() takes an optional parameter, encoding. Its default value is ‘utf-8’, so you don’t need to specify it unless you think the text you have received was in some other encoding than ‘utf-8’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "You may see a u before the string in a Python 2.7 program indicating that it’s a unicode string. In Python 3, all strings are unicode strings, so you shouldn’t encounter any of those strange u characters in this textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have python strings, everything will work fine until you try to print or write the contents to a file. If you print, and your terminal window is not set up to display that language, you may get a strange output, or an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to write to a file with unicode strings, you may get an error. When you write a unicode string to a file, Python tries to encode it in ASCII. If there is a non-ASCII character, the execution fails and raises an error that looks like this: UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\\xea' in position 1: ordinal not in range(128).\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution is to use the Python method to encode the string, using a format such as utf-8. For example, s.encode('utf-8') will encode string s as utf-8. That will encode non-ASCII characters with multiple character sequences that are difficult for people to read but can decoded back into single Unicode characters. This is often the best way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another quick-and-dirty option, if you just have a few stray characters that are getting in your way, is to replace any non-ASCII characters with question marks. For example, s.encode('ascii', 'replace'). Of course, replacing characters with question marks destroys some of the information, but it may be helpful in some circumstances.\n"
