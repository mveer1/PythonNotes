    "We said that inheritance provides us a more elegant way of, for example, creating Dog and Cat types, rather than making a very complex Pet class. In the abstract, this is pretty intuitive: all pets have certain things, but dogs != cats != birds. Going a step further, Collie dog != Labrador dog. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance provides us with an easy and elegant way to represent these differences.\n",
    "Basically, it works by defining a new class, and using a special syntax to show what the new sub-class inherits from a super-class. So if you wanted to define a Dog class as a special kind of Pet, you would say that the Dog type inherits from the Pet type.\n",
